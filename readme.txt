== Description ==

This plugin displays functional compounding investment calculator. It can be used how a hypothetical investment can grow over time. It allows partial compounding. For every investment period the user can see the balance, the earned interest for the period, the cash withdrawn in case they decide to withdraw part of the profits, and the total ROI. The calculator illustrates how the return on investment grows exponentially if you choose to compound your profits.
